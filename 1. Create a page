1. Create a page
2. Page should contain a form and a table
3. form should take first name (required, min: 3, max: 10), last name (same as first name) and email(req, email format) as inputs and a submit button
4. On click of submit button, you should validate the fields and show relevant errors if any
5. Below the form there should be table which should have 6 columns
	(S no, first name, last name, email, edit and delete)
6. S no columns should start from 1 and move on in single increments
7. Edit and delete columns should have buttons (edit in green color and delete in red)
8. When I click on delete button in any row, that entire row should disappear
9. When I click on Edit button, the row information should re-fill in the above form and you should show save and cancel button instead of submit button.
10. When I click edit after editing the information, the respective row should update with edited information and form should clear and should show submit button
11. If I click cancel button, the form should clear and submit button should be shown.
12. Nice to have: When I click edit button, the respective row in table should be highlighted with a background color, The highlighted background color should be removed when user clicks on save/cancel button.
